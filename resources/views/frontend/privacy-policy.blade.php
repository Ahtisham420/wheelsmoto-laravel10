We do not seek to identify individual visitors unless they volunteer their contact details through one of the forms on the site. Various forms on our site invite you to submit your contact details and other information about yourself or your organisation, or to send us emails which may, of course, also identify you. In each case, the purpose for which you are invited to give us information is clear and we also indicate which of the requested information is essential for the relevant purpose and which is optional - fields for essential information are marked with an asterisk. We will only use your details to send you information from Wheelshunt that you have specifically requested to receive. Or from time to time any promotional offers. If you no longer wish to receive such information, our emails contain a link that will allow you to change or terminate your subscription to our email alerting service. Alternatively, you can let us know your preferences by sending an email to

Wheelshunt strives to protect the security of information that you provide us, and will comply at all time with its statutory and any other obligations in this regard.
